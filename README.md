# 🧠 GeoMentor Prompts
Welcome to **GeoMentor Prompts**, the ultimate **Geospatial AI & Spatial Data Science Prompt Library**. This repository provides a structured collection of **domain-specific prompt engineering templates** designed for **data scientists**, **business owners**, and **developers** working with geospatial intelligence, data science, and location-based AI applications.

## 🚀 About This Repository

GeoMentor Prompts is a **comprehensive geospatial AI ecosystem** that combines two powerful components:

1. **GeoMentor Prompts Library**: A knowledge hub of AI-driven insights for geospatial analysis, automation, and decision-making. We combine **Human Intelligence (HI) with AI capabilities** to create high-quality prompts tailored for real-world geospatial use cases.

2. **Location MCP Server**: A comprehensive location-based services implementation using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing geocoding, routing, elevation, places search, and map visualization capabilities.

## What You'll Find

### 📝 **GeoMentor Prompts Library**
- **Curated prompt templates** for spatial data science, remote sensing, spatial data science, and business intelligence.
- **Categorized prompts** based on user personas: Data Scientists, Business Owners, and Developers.
- **AI-powered retrieval**: Easily search and access relevant prompts.
- **Best practices in prompt engineering** for geospatial AI applications.

### 🌍 **Location MCP Server**
